I decided to keep track of my thoughts here in Github and have version control for them. It is scary because not only my thoughts are public; not that I'm afraid of becoming popular one day but the whole history of my thoughts, my thought process will be public. So, if I write something offensive or wrong and want to come back and change it - that will not be gone forever. It really is OK because I believe in making mistakes, also some forms of `embarrasement` is useful for one's emotional development.

I think the biggest challenge will be being consistent like with anything.

This also reminds me how my mom had me practice math questions when I was young: If I made a mistake, I was not allowed to use an eraser to erase it. I would put a huge X on it with red pencil and write the correct solution right under it, so I could see and compare what I did wrong.

My mom was loving most of the time and militaristic at some other times. 

Anyway, this is slightly exciting.
